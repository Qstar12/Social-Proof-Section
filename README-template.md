## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

One area that I personally struggle with is accessibility and I learned that there are resources such as ./https://www.a11yproject.com/checklist/#global-code. What helped me overview accessibility guidlines.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:


###code I'd like to showcase
```scss

:root {
    --clr-primary-700: hsl(300, 43%, 22%);
    --clr-primary-300: hsl(333, 80%, 67%);

    --clr-neutral-500: hsl(303, 10%, 53%);
    --clr-neutral-400: hsl(300, 24%, 96%);
    --clr-neutral-100: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);

    --ff-primary:'spartan', sans-serif;

    
    --fs-base: 0.8125rem;
    --fs-lg: 1rem;
    --fs-xlg: 2rem;

    @media (min-width: 50em) {
        --fs-xlg: 3rem;
    }
  
}

```

### Continued development

I will conitue to work with CSS Grid in firefox instead of Goodle Chrome. Personally, I feel that the dev tools that are available in Firefox are much better when it comes to working with grid. I will also challege myself to begin to work on larger projects.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://youtu.be/K27WULzr2P8) - If you don't follow Kevin Powell's YouTube he post awesome tourtorials. I followed his framework mainly for formatting purposes.
